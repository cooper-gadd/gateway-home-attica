# Charitable Giving

Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs) allow eligible IRA owners aged 70.5+ to make tax-free transfers directly to charities.

## How it works:

- The IRA trustee sends the funds directly to the charity
- The donor can request multiple QCDs in a year, but the total amount excluded from income is limited to $105,000 in 2024
- QCDs can count toward the required minimum distribution (RMD) for the year for those who are at least 73 years old
- The IRA trustee reports the QCD on the account owner's annual tax return, Form 1099-R

## Who can make a QCD?

- Eligible IRA owners who are at least 70.5 years old
- Married couples who meet the qualifications and have separate IRAs

## How to make a QCD?

1. Contact the IRA trustee to request a form or instructions for making a QCD
2. Provide the trustee with the name and address of the charity, and the amount of the donation
3. Review and submit the request

## When to consider making a QCD?

- A QCD can be a good way to give to charity before the end of the year
- A QCD can be a way to claim a state tax deduction
- A QCD can be a way to avoid income restrictions on charitable deductions
