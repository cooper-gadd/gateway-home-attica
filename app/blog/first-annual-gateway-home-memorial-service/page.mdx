The first annual Gateway Home Memorial service was held on November 13, 2024 at the 1st Baptist Church in Attica.

The service recognized the 77 souls that have lived and passed away within our walls. It was a time for the families to reconnect with the caregivers that assisted with their loved ones. A time to reminisce about their loved ones. A time to remember.

Board President Doug Domes sang a beautiful song which talked about the beauty of waking up in Heaven. One of the lyrics that stood out to me was,

> "But just think of stepping on shore-And finding it Heaven! Of touching a hand-And finding it God's! Of breathing new air-And finding it celestial! Of waking up in glory-And finding it home!"

What a peaceful way to think of the transition of our loved ones!

A speech by Gateway Home director, Sara Brunner, reminded families to "come home" to Gateway when they need to feel close to their person or if they need support. Reminding them that once they are here, they are part of the family and our care for them stays even after their loved one has gone.

The candlelight service concluded with a lovely fellowship hour complete with pie made and served by Rosie Domes and the ladies of the 1st Baptist church.
