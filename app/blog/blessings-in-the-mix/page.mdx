Every year we gather together in the early part of "spring". We bake up some delicious pancakes, sausage, and eggs. We put out some pretty baskets all done up in ribbons. Linda starts the coffee, and then we wait. We wait almost like kids on Christmas Eve. And just like Santa, every year there you are!

The magic of seeing each of you come through the door never gets old. The moment of recognizing each face and the overjoyed hugs of reunions. It's my favorite part. Sure the pancakes are top notch, and no one can beat local maple syrup, but the faces and the "how are yous" still take the top spot.

If you've been to one of our pancake breakfasts you will understand when I say that the setting is definitely intimate. You have no choice to become friends with the folks sharing your table. No better ice breaker around than "pass the syrup, please". This is just the way we like it. You see, we've gotten to know and love each of you one family at a time. Whether through fundraising, support, or if your family has stayed with us in the house. We've grieved with you, we've laughed with you, we've prayed with you, we've said thanks for you. Pancake day is the time when we get to see each of you start getting to know each other. Brought together by your love and support of our mission. Bonding over carbs, as it should be.

To each of you who took time out of your Sunday to stop in and share a stack with us, Thank You! You are the reason we keep on. Our community can't be beat.
Until next year, remember to mix in some love and always be willing to open your heart to the folks passing the syrup.

Love and Hugs, Sara
