During the Christmas season, so much attention is given to gatherings, lights, and celebration. And yet, some of the most meaningful moments unfold quietly — in the overnight hours, when the building is still and comfort is offered through presence more than words.
One of our overnight aides recently shared an essay reflecting on why she does this work and what it means to care for others during those most tender hours. Her words capture the heart of Gateway Home in a way no report or holiday message ever could.
With her permission, we wanted to share her reflection with you this Christmas — a reminder that the care you make possible lives in gentle moments, steady compassion, and the simple act of being there when it matters most.

> "It's quiet here in the home...too quiet tonight, I feel it. A photograph sits on the table of a man so perfectly able of living life to the fullest. He stands with his family and a smile on his face.
This eve, it almost feels out of place.
I walk down the fall, turn on the light, standing in the room alone, thinking of the other night.. His family surrounding him. so much love in this room. I felt it. Behind the door a great sadness hides.
I step inside.
All together in care and love.
Waiting and watching for
God above
to move.
to take him in His arms for all eternity, away from them for a moment, but free from suffering.
Sometimes I wonder, what's the point of it all?
To do unto others as I'd have them do to me...
to give of myself wholeheartedly, albeit imperfectly.
to do my best, so his family can rest and know he is safe in my care.
To listen, hold space, share a story, offer an embrace, a hot cup of coffee in a mug is a hug.
This all makes sense in a world that often makes none. It's worth the sleepless nights and the too tired days. The tears that I cry that no one sees and the prayers that I pray that no one hears.
This is the point.
It is the call on my life when I wasn't listening. I am listening now. I hear. I answer. Seeing with eyes wide open. Hearing an angel's melody.
Each one a gift for a moment...
Forever in my heart.
Gone from my sight, but never forgotten.
I am fully alive."
