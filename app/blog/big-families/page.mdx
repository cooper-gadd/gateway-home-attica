One of the things you will frequently hear me say is, "once you are here, you are our family." Family means a lot of different things to people. I, personally, started as a family of 3. I was an only child with my mom and dad. Then our family became just 2, my mom and I. When I was 12 my mom fell in love and my family became a family of 6! Many things were different about each situation, but a few important things remained no matter the size of the family. There was always love. There was always support. And there was always really good food.

When someone enters Gateway Home for their transition from this life, they come to us in many different ways. Some are surrounded by family. Some have one or two steadfast family members. And sometimes someone comes to us and they are alone. A family of one. No matter how many they come in with, they leave as a family of MANY.

Our volunteers and staff have the special knack for loving people well. Whether it's with a pot of fresh coffee, warm chocolate chip cookies, or an empathetic shoulder, they find a way to connect with families and make them understand that they are no longer in it alone.

Support during an end-of-life situation is a very crucial part of making it as gentle as possible. You are always going to lose your person. No one can take away that pain, but having someone who understands and listens makes that pain a bit easier to bear. That pain doesn't go away in the few days, weeks, or months that you are likely here with us. Neither does our support. We are here for you and our love and care extends to you far after your person has journeyed on. Come home when you need us. We are here. We are thrilled to see you. And we always have really good food.
