I wanted to hop on the trend and give you a small look at what Gateway Home looks like in numbers for 2025, or as the cool kids like to call it, Gateway Home Wrapped.

## Resident Care

* Volunteers willing to put in 2,697 hours of resident care (on the books)!
* It took 44 resident care volunteers to run Gateway this year.
* We added 9 new caregivers to the mix!
* We welcomed home a few familiar faces, too!

## Fundraising

* It took around 200 fundraising volunteers to make Gateway run this year! HOLY CATS!
* Those volunteers worked 18 Darien Lake concerts all through the summer, 2 golf tournaments, 2 chicken BBQs, a meat raffle, a car show, a pancake breakfast, plus the raffles and football pools.
* We tried to calculate the hours put in to the planning and carrying out of these amazing events, and let's just say half way through we decided to bake the fundraising team some cookies. We have volunteers for that, too!

## Board of Directors

* 5 Board members willing to share talent, time, and expertise.
* 3(ish) meeting hours a month, plus countless hours outside of meetings.
* 10 hands on deck to lend wherever the team needs.
* 5 hearts that are dedicated to our mission.

## Building and Grounds

* 5 volunteers willing to get their hands dirty
* 1 shed full of rakes, shovels, lawncare equipment, and a snow blower
* Countless mornings of getting up early to be sure our volunteers, staff, and overnight staff do not slip on ice and snow coming in or out of the home.
* More leaves and branches then you can shake a stick at (see what I did there 😂)
* Many light bulb changes and calls of "is this supposed to wiggle?"

## Thank You Committee

* 13 members willing to write in cursive.
* 641 hand written cards to our donors.
* Many hours of cramped hands, but warm hearts.

## Cleaning Crew

* 4 members willing to scrub!
* 26 spur of the moment top to bottom room cleanings
* 2x weekly housekeeping visits
* Countless rolls of Bounty
* Loudest laughs

To all of our many volunteers, there is no way to quantify the love, empathy, and care you bring in and out of our home each and every day. Your ideas, time, talent, and willingness to give of yourself to our mission is never taken for granted!

If you have ever wanted to volunteer and you weren't sure there was a place for you, look above, there is a place for everyone at Gateway!

Here is to 2026 and a fresh new year of memories and mission!
