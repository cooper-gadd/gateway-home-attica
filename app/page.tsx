                      Palliative care can be appropriate at any stage of an
                      illness. It is a holistic approach to health care that
                      goes beyond the physical wellbeing of the resident,
                      attending to their spiritual, emotional and psychological
                      needs. Hospice care is a specialized form of palliative
                      care designed to support those in the final stages of a
                      terminal illness. Comfort Care is available during the
                      last 90 days of someoneâ€™s life with the resident and
                      family agreeing there will be no heroic measures taken to
                      prolong life.

                      residents. We are an independent, not-for-profit
                      organization and money to run Gateway Home is generated
                      entirely through community support, donations and grants.
                      Our annual operating expenses must be covered by monies
                      received from memorials, honorary donations, bequests,
                      donations from people, corporations, service
                      organizations, plus grants and fund-raising events.

                      A nonprofit grant is financial support given to nonprofits
                      by corporations, foundations, or government agencies. They
                      are beneficial for nonprofits because they provide the
                      opportunity for additional funding that doesnâ€™t need to be
                      paid back and they increase awareness of their
                      organization. Grants have also allowed us to make some
                      improvements to our property that wouldnâ€™t have been
                      possible without the additional funding. Gateway Home
                      relies solely on fundraising, memorials, donations, and
                      grants for funding. With operating expenses exceeding
                      $200k per year a lot of hard work and research is done to
                      apply for grants in hopes of receiving funds to help keep
                      our doors open. Gateway Home has been fortunate enough to
                      be granted several grants over the years that allowed the
                      doors to open and that have helped make it possible for us
                      to serve our community.

                      Admission to Gateway Home is based on an assessment of
                      those who have the greatest need and the fewest options. A
                      physician must have determined that the person has a
                      terminal illness and is in their last three months of
                      life. We are not able to accept every person who is
                      referred and can only care for up to two residents at one
                      time. Each case is evaluated carefully by our Assessment
                      Caregivers and Director of Resident Care and priority is
                      given to those people who have the greatest need at the
                      time; i.e., those who are at home with limited adequate
                      care giving support. Other considerations involve the
                      complexity of nursing care that some people may require.

                      We do not use intravenous fluids, feeding tubes or CPR

                      management, and symptom control will accompany a natural
                      death process, in an atmosphere filled with love. It is
                      not uncommon to have multiple people waiting for the next
                      available bed. When a bed is available, our Assessment
                      team evaluates all who are waiting, and choose the one who
                      has the greatest need; not who is next on the list for
                      admission.

                      The process for admission to Gateway Home begins with a
                      referral from a physician, social worker, family member,
                      friend, or other healthcare provider. Once a referral is
                      received, our Assessment team will contact the person who
                      is referred to schedule an assessment. The assessment is
                      done in the personâ€™s home or hospital room and takes about
                      an hour. During the assessment, the personâ€™s medical
                      history, current symptoms, and care needs are discussed.
                      The personâ€™s family members or caregivers are also
                      encouraged to participate in the assessment. After the
                      assessment is completed, the person is placed on our
                      waiting list. When a bed becomes available, the person is
                      admitted to Gateway Home. The personâ€™s family members or
                      caregivers are encouraged to visit Gateway Home before the
                      person is admitted to become familiar with the facility
                      and meet the staff. Once the person is admitted, the
                      personâ€™s family members or caregivers are encouraged to
                      visit as often as they like. We also encourage family
                      members or caregivers to participate in the personâ€™s care
                      as much as they are able. We believe that family members
                      and caregivers are an important part of the personâ€™s care
                      team and we welcome their involvement. We also provide
                      support and education to family members and caregivers to
                      help them care for their loved one. We believe that
                      involving family members and caregivers in the personâ€™s
                      care helps to improve the personâ€™s quality of life and
                      provides comfort and support to the person and their
                      family members or caregivers. We also provide support and
                      education to family members and caregivers to help them
                      care for their loved one. We believe that involving family
                      members and caregivers in the personâ€™s care helps to
                      improve the personâ€™s quality of life and provides comfort
                      and support to the person and their family members or
                      caregivers.
