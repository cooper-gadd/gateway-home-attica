            Gateway Home is established to give comfort care to people who are
            medically determined to be in their last stages of life (three
            months or less). Our organization will provide both medical and
            spiritual care to support the residents as they pass from this life
            to the next. Gateway Home staff and volunteers are committed to
            provide dignified care, comfort, and support for our residents and
            their families. Gateway Home is a nonprofit organization, and does
            not charge for services provided. Funding is accomplished through
            donations, bequests, and community support. Admission is based
            solely on need.

                Gateway Home is an empathetic and loving comfort care home for
                the terminally ill. It is a home-like setting that offers free
                comfort care for those in their last three months of a terminal
                illness. Gateway Homeâ€™s staff and trained volunteers are able to
                care for two residents at a time, 24 hours a day, 365 days a
                year. Our primary goal is to provide comfort care, symptom
                control and pain management for our residents, as well as to be
                a source of respite care for the families and friends. Hands-on
                resident care is provided around the clock, along with meals,
                laundry, companionship, as well as emotional, and spiritual
                support. Comfort care honors the well-being of every person and
                respects the dignity of human life. Admission to Gateway Home is
                based solely on need, regardless of age, sex, race, religion or
                other distinctions . Referrals come from several sources:
                Hospice, health care agencies, hospitals, physicians, social
                workers, clergy, family, friends or the person themselves.
                Priority is given to those who cannot receive adequate care at
                home. There is no cost to the families that we serve, nor do we
                receive any reimbursement from insurance companies. Gateway Home
                is funded solely by donations, fundraising, memorial
                contributions and through the generosity of our community.

                  Palliative care can be appropriate at any stage of an illness.
                  It is a holistic approach to health care that goes beyond the
                  physical wellbeing of the resident, attending to their
                  spiritual, emotional and psychological needs. Hospice care is
                  a specialized form of palliative care designed to support
                  those in the final stages of a terminal illness. Comfort Care
                  is available during the last 90 days of someoneâ€™s life with
                  the resident and family agreeing there will be no heroic
                  measures taken to prolong life.

                  Our services are provided free-of-charge to our homeâ€™s
                  residents. We are an independent, not-for-profit organization
                  and money to run Gateway Home is generated entirely through
                  community support, donations and grants. Our annual operating
                  expenses must be covered by monies received from memorials,
                  honorary donations, bequests, donations from people,
                  corporations, service organizations, plus grants and
                  fund-raising events.

                  A nonprofit grant is financial support given to nonprofits by
                  corporations, foundations, or government agencies. They are
                  beneficial for nonprofits because they provide the opportunity
                  for additional funding that doesnâ€™t need to be paid back and
                  they increase awareness of their organization. Grants have
                  also allowed us to make some improvements to our property that
                  wouldnâ€™t have been possible without the additional funding.
                  Gateway Home relies solely on fundraising, memorials,
                  donations, and grants for funding. With operating expenses
                  exceeding $200k per year a lot of hard work and research is
                  done to apply for grants in hopes of receiving funds to help
                  keep our doors open. Gateway Home has been fortunate enough to
                  be granted several grants over the years that allowed the
                  doors to open and that have helped make it possible for us to
                  serve our community.

                  We have been generously supported by various grant sources.

                  All care given at Gateway Home is provided by volunteers or
                  staff members who are trained to provide the best possible
                  care. We change caregivers every two hours during our day and
                  evening shifts so our caregivers come in renewed and
                  refreshed. Our overnight shift from 10-8 is usually manned by
                  one caregiver. Interested individuals do not need to have any
                  healthcare experience to become a volunteer â€“ just an open
                  heart and a willingness to learn how to care for another
                  person. We help volunteers do the rest!

                <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
                  Admission to Gateway Home is based on an assessment of those
                  who have the greatest need and the fewest options. A physician
                  must have determined that the person has a terminal illness
                  and is in their last three months of life. We are not able to
                  accept every person who is referred and can only care for up
                  to two dying residents at one time. Each case is evaluated
                  carefully by our Assessment Caregivers and Director of
                  Resident Care and priority is given to those people who have
                  the greatest need at the time; i.e., those who are at home
                  with limited adequate care giving support. Other
                  considerations involve the complexity of nursing care that
                  some people may require.

                  We do not use intravenous fluids, feeding tubes or CPR
                  (resuscitation). It ensures that comfort care, pain

                  process, in an atmosphere filled with love. It is not uncommon
                  to have multiple people waiting for the next available bed.
                  When a bed is available, our Assessment team evaluates all who
                  are waiting, and choose the one who has the greatest need; not
                  who is next on the list for admission.

                <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
                  The process for admission to Gateway Home begins with a
                  referral from a physician, social worker, family member,
                  friend, or other healthcare provider. Once a referral is
                  received, our Assessment team will contact the person who is
                  referred to schedule an assessment. The assessment is done in
                  the personâ€™s home or hospital room and takes about an hour.
                  During the assessment, the personâ€™s medical history, current
                  symptoms, and care needs are discussed. The personâ€™s family
                  members or caregivers are also encouraged to participate in
                  the assessment. After the assessment is completed, the person
                  is placed on our waiting list. When a bed becomes available,
                  the person is admitted to Gateway Home. The personâ€™s family
                  members or caregivers are encouraged to visit Gateway Home
                  before the person is admitted to become familiar with the
                  facility and meet the staff. Once the person is admitted, the
                  personâ€™s family members or caregivers are encouraged to visit
                  as often as they like. We also encourage family members or
                  caregivers to participate in the personâ€™s care as much as they
                  are able. We believe that family members and caregivers are an
                  important part of the personâ€™s care team and we welcome their
                  involvement. We also provide support and education to family
                  members and caregivers to help them care for their loved one.
                  We believe that involving family members and caregivers in the
                  personâ€™s care helps to improve the personâ€™s quality of life
                  and provides comfort and support to the person and their
                  family members or caregivers. We also provide support and
                  education to family members and caregivers to help them care
                  for their loved one. We believe that involving family members
                  and caregivers in the personâ€™s care helps to improve the
                  personâ€™s quality of life and provides comfort and support to
                  the person and their family members or caregivers.
