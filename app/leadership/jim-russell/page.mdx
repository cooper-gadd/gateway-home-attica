# Jim Russell

**Board Vice President**

Jim has lived in Batavia for over 50 years, many of which he owned and operated a fire and safety company. He has 3 children and 4 grandchildren. Over the years he has volunteered and served on many committees such as Volunteer Firefighter for the Town of Stafford and Town of Batavia Fire Departments, Batavia City Councilman, City of Batavia Zoning Board and Knights of Columbus Council 11728.

Jim first became involved with Gateway Home in February 2020 when he brought his wife, Judy of 47 years to Gateway Home as her battle with lung cancer was coming to an end. After Judy’s passing Jim wanted to give back to Gateway Home for the support they provided. Jim organized a Chicken BBQ fundraiser that summer at Gateway Home. After that he began serving on the Board of Directors in 2021.  Jim continues to honor Judy’s memory by organizing and cooking two Chicken BBQ fundraisers each year for Gateway Home. In July 2022, he also started the First Annual Judy Russell Memorial Golf Tournament with all the proceeds raised donated to Gateway Home.
