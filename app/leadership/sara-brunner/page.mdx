# Sara Brunner

**Director**

Sara's journey to Gateway Home is deeply rooted in her personal experiences and professional background. Residing in Batavia with her beloved family, she found her calling in end-of-life care following the loss of her close friend Wendy. Witnessing the profound impact of love and compassion during Wendy's final moments solidified Sara's commitment to this field.

Sue lives in Attica with her husband, Don and son, Isaac. Sue and Don also have 3 adult children and 4 grandchildren. She is excited to add her creativity and enthusiasm to help promote Gateway Homeâ€™s mission.
