# Donna Ferry

**Board Member**

Donna Ferry lives in Darien and retired several years ago from S.J.F. Construction, Inc.  She has volunteered for several organizations that have allowed her to connect with the community including serving on the Board of Trustees at Genesee Community College.

After losing her mother to a short illness in 2021 her thoughts turned to the importance of end-of-life care and she began volunteering at Gateway Home in 2022 along with assisting with fundraising endeavors.

Serving alongside amazing volunteers and care givers has been a truly humbling experience for Donna and has strengthen her resolve to support Gateway Home in their mission. Donna joined the board in January 2023 and looks forward to working with the staff, volunteers, care givers, and fellow board members.
