# Todd Gadd

**Board Treasurer**

Todd Gadd was led to be involved with a comfort care facility following an opportunity to serve others on a short-term mission trip to the Dominican Republic. This was following the passing of his mother during her illness in which her family had the privilege to take care of her at home until her passing. He has been part of the group that has organized Gateway Home and is now serving on the Board of Directors. Todd is married to Brittany and has two children, Cooper and Chloe. He grew up in Attica and currently lives in Cowlesville, NY. Being involved with such a much-needed organization whose purpose is to only help others has been very rewarding.
