# Sue Herman

**Office Manager**

Sue joined our team when we opened our doors in December 2019 and handles the day to day office tasks such as bookkeeping, mail and telephone. She also helps coordinate our volunteer scheduling and is often the voice behind the One Call messaging system. She is a graduate of Canisius College and is a certified public accountant. She previously worked for Farm Credit East as an agricultural income tax preparer. Sue keeps her hands in agriculture by continuing to do some on-farm bookkeeping as time permits. She enjoys volunteering with Attica Youth Athletics and is a member of the Attica Central School Board of Education.

Sue lives in Attica with her husband, Don and son, Isaac. Sue and Don also have 3 adult children and 4 grandchildren. She is excited to add her creativity and enthusiasm to help promote Gateway Homeâ€™s mission.
