# Doug Domes

**Board President**

Doug has lived his life as a resident of Attica with wife Rosie of 55 years. He has four children who have blessed him with 16 beautiful grandchildren. As a businessman in the timber industry, Doug knows trees to be God’s only renewable natural resource for all of us to use wisely and has learned to respect this resource.

Doug recognizes the value of a human’s heart, soul, and body and as a result sees “Gateway Home” as a chance to give back or pass onto those in need the blessing God has bestowed on him. He wants to help those who are facing their last days, weeks, or possible months on this earth not fearing their ultimate departure from this earth. Doug believes it is important for them to know they are loved and valued by being cared for physically, emotionally, and spiritually. The bible states the Golden Rule as “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” Showing love and caring for others is the means by which we all should live.
