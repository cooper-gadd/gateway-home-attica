You never had to worry about

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.500
whether or not grandpa and grandma were

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.500
taken care of day or night you always

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.500
knew that

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.000
when that staff would come in

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and say "Hi Pat, how are you doing today?"

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
they weren't just saying that

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
you knew they meant that they also took

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
care of us as a family coming in

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
my dad

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
was diagnosed with lung cancer

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Dad fooled everybody he had a passion

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
for life

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
passion to live

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Initially we took care of him at a home

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.500
and

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.000
did so for a little over four years

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
as

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
the cancer progressed it became more

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
evident that

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
we were going to need more help

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
They always seemed to know right when we

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
needed someone to put an arm around us

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and give us a hug or when they

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
or if we needed that extra time to be

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
alone with grandpa or grandma or by

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
ourselves on the porch right outside

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
they just knew

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and we were able to be with dad when he

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
passed

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
My name is Patrick Garrison, I am Jessica

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
comfort care facility my family

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:35.000

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:51.000
