You never had to worry about

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.500
whether or not grandpa and grandma were

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.500
taken care of day or night you always

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.500
knew that

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.000
when that staff would come in

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and say "Hi Pat, how are you doing today?"

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
they weren't just saying that

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
you knew they meant that they also took

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
care of us as a family coming in

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
my dad

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
was diagnosed with lung cancer

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Dad fooled everybody he had a passion

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
for life

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
passion to live

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Initially we took care of him at a home

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.500
and

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.000
did so for a little over four years

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
as

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
the cancer progressed it became more

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
evident that

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
we were going to need more help

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
They always seemed to know right when we

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
needed someone to put an arm around us

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and give us a hug or when they

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
or if we needed that extra time to be

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
alone with grandpa or grandma or by

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
ourselves on the porch right outside

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
they just knew

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and we were able to be with dad when he

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
passed

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
My name is Patrick Garrison, I am Jessica

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
comfort care facility my family

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:34.000

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:50.000
