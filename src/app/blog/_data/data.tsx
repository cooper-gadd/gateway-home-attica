          Brick by brick, those who wanted to honor the memory of a Gateway Home

          Gateway Director Sara Brunner said the brick walkways part of the
          project took about a year. Gateway, 91 Main St., is a home for the
          terminally ill offering free comfort care for those in their last
          three months of a terminal illness.

        <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          Each brick, Brunner said, is a representation of love and memories
          from everyone at the dedication.

          “Piece by piece, the road to Gateway is truly paved with the beloved
          remembrances of those who have gone before us. In this way, you have
          chosen to have their name and their legacy remembered. You have also
          supported this mission to move forward and make a lasting contribution
          to others whom we have yet to meet,” she said. “Walking in every
          morning brings a smile to my face to think of these beautiful souls
          that we have cared for and the lovely supporters who think that what
          we’re doing here is worth investing in.”
        </blockquote>

          Brunner invited those who had bought bricks for the walkways to come
          to Gateway Home when they need to feel close to the loved ones in
          whose memory they bought them.

          serve as a reminder of their contributions and as a symbol of the
          values they held dear. We appreciate each and every one of you.
          Without every person in this audience, what we do here and the impact

          Another wonderful project for the Gateway Home done and ready for the
          resident families to enjoy spending time with loved ones on the
          decorative concrete pad and underneath the new fancy pergola. Once
          again, it was a project that just simply couldn’t have gotten done
          without the help of the community stepping up and volunteering.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          The hands-on portion of this project started Memorial Day weekend as
          Doug Domes, Todd Gadd, Greg Scholand and I began digging and prepping
          the area for concrete. Once the dirt and stone settled through time,
          the next step was to form and pour the concrete pad. That’s when we
          needed the expertise of masons. Dave Reding and brothers, Guy and
          Dustin Westermeier graciously volunteered and stepped in to pour the
          decorative concrete pad. The team nailed it by doing an absolutely
          amazing job that shows in the pictures, yet only gives justice when
          you see it in person.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          Last week was the final step to the project. With the help and
          carpentry skills of Roger Blair, Bill Hulme and Bob Rebmann, the
          pergola was finally erected. This just brought everything all together
          in a way that exceeded our expectations since planning the project
          many months ago.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          This project was yet another eye opener. Each volunteer did this not
          for the pat on the back or praise, but for their community and in some
          cases, in memory of loved ones of their own. It was truly an honor
          working with all of them to see this project through.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          I’d like to personally thank everyone who helped make this community
          project possible from start to finish. I know the folks at the Gateway
          Home are extremely pleased with the outcome and the families who will
          use it, I’m sure will appreciate what you’ve all done to provide this
          to them.
