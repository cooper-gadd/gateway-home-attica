          What are Palliative Care, Hospice and Comfort Care?
        </h2>
        <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          Palliative care can be appropriate at any stage of an illness. It is a
          holistic approach to health care that goes beyond the physical
          wellbeing of the resident, attending to their spiritual, emotional and
          psychological needs. Hospice care is a specialized form of palliative
          care designed to support those in the final stages of a terminal
          illness. Comfort Care is available during the last 90 days of
          someone’s life with the resident and family agreeing there will be no
          heroic measures taken to prolong life.

          How is Gateway Home Funded?
        </h2>
        <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          Our services are provided free-of-charge to our home’s residents. We
          are an independent, not-for-profit organization and money to run
          Gateway Home is generated entirely through community support,
          donations and grants. Our annual operating expenses must be covered by
          monies received from memorials, honorary donations, bequests,
          donations from people, corporations, service organizations, plus
          grants and fund-raising events.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          A nonprofit grant is financial support given to nonprofits by
          corporations, foundations, or government agencies. They are beneficial
          for nonprofits because they provide the opportunity for additional
          funding that doesn’t need to be paid back and they increase awareness
          of their organization. Grants have also allowed us to make some
          improvements to our property that wouldn’t have been possible without
          the additional funding. Gateway Home relies solely on fundraising,
          memorials, donations, and grants for funding. With operating expenses
          exceeding $200k per year a lot of hard work and research is done to
          apply for grants in hopes of receiving funds to help keep our doors
          open. Gateway Home has been fortunate enough to be granted several
          grants over the years that allowed the doors to open and that have
          helped make it possible for us to serve our community.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          We have been generously supported by various grant sources. The{" "}
          <strong>Hope</strong> grant was used for home improvement. The{" "}
          <strong>Conable Family Foundation</strong> and the{" "}
          <strong>East Hill Foundation</strong> grants were utilized for
          renovations. The <strong>William F. Thiel Trust</strong> provided us
          with funds for medical equipment. The{" "}
          <strong>Ralph C. Wilson Legacy Funds</strong> were used for caregiver
          training and operating expenses. <strong>Home Depot</strong> provided
          us with a grant for an ADA compliant ramp. The{" "}
          <strong>Garman Family Foundation</strong> funded a generator for us.{" "}
          <strong>United Way</strong> contributed to our operating expenses, and
          the <strong>Odd Fellow & Rebekah</strong> grant was used for nurses
          and care aid payroll. These grants have played a significant role in
          helping us continue to fulfill our mission.

          Who provides direct care at Gateway Home?
        </h2>
        <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          All care given at Gateway Home is provided by volunteers or staff
          members who are trained to provide the best possible care. We change
          caregivers every two hours during our day and evening shifts so our
          caregivers come in renewed and refreshed. Our overnight shift from
          10-8 is usually manned by one caregiver. Interested individuals do not
          need to have any healthcare experience to become a volunteer – just an
          open heart and a willingness to learn how to care for another person.
          We help volunteers do the rest!

          Who is eligible for admission to Gateway Home?
        </h2>
        <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          Admission to Gateway Home is based on an assessment of those who have
          the greatest need and the fewest options. A physician must have
          determined that the person has a terminal illness and is in their last
          three months of life. We are not able to accept every person who is
          referred and can only care for up to two dying residents at one time.
          Each case is evaluated carefully by our Assessment Caregivers and
          Director of Resident Care and priority is given to those people who
          have the greatest need at the time; i.e., those who are at home with
          limited adequate care giving support. Other considerations involve the
          complexity of nursing care that some people may require.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          We do not use intravenous fluids, feeding tubes or CPR
          (resuscitation). It ensures that comfort care, pain management, and
          symptom control will accompany a natural death process, in an
          atmosphere filled with love. It is not uncommon to have multiple
          people waiting for the next available bed. When a bed is available,
          our Assessment team evaluates all who are waiting, and choose the one
          who has the greatest need; not who is next on the list for admission.

          What is the process for admission to Gateway Home?
        </h2>
        <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          The process for admission to Gateway Home begins with a referral from
          a physician, social worker, family member, friend, or other healthcare
          provider. Once a referral is received, our Assessment team will
          contact the person who is referred to schedule an assessment. The
          assessment is done in the person’s home or hospital room and takes
          about an hour. During the assessment, the person’s medical history,
          current symptoms, and care needs are discussed. The person’s family
          members or caregivers are also encouraged to participate in the
          assessment. After the assessment is completed, the person is placed on
          our waiting list. When a bed becomes available, the person is admitted
          to Gateway Home. The person’s family members or caregivers are
          encouraged to visit Gateway Home before the person is admitted to
          become familiar with the facility and meet the staff. Once the person
          is admitted, the person’s family members or caregivers are encouraged
          to visit as often as they like. We also encourage family members or
          caregivers to participate in the person’s care as much as they are
          able. We believe that family members and caregivers are an important
          part of the person’s care team and we welcome their involvement. We
          also provide support and education to family members and caregivers to
          help them care for their loved one. We believe that involving family
          members and caregivers in the person’s care helps to improve the
          person’s quality of life and provides comfort and support to the
          person and their family members or caregivers. We also provide support
          and education to family members and caregivers to help them care for
          their loved one. We believe that involving family members and
          caregivers in the person’s care helps to improve the person’s quality
          of life and provides comfort and support to the person and their
          family members or caregivers.

          What items should my loved one bring to Gateway Home?
        </h2>
        <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          When a person is admitted to Gateway Home, they are encouraged to
          bring personal items that will make them feel more at home. We
          encourage residents to bring their own clothing, personal care items,
          and any other items that will make them feel more comfortable. We
          provide all the necessary medical equipment and supplies, as well as
          snacks. We also provide all the necessary linens and towels. We have a
          washer and dryer on site for residents to use. We also have a small
          library of books, puzzles, and games for residents to enjoy. We have a
          beautiful garden and patio area for residents to enjoy the outdoors.
          We also have a large living room with a fireplace and a television for
          residents to enjoy. We encourage residents to bring their own personal
          items to make their stay more comfortable. We also encourage family
          members to visit often and to participate in the care of their loved
          one. We have a family room with a kitchenette and a dining area for
          family members to use. We also have a small chapel for residents and
          family members to use for prayer and reflection.

          What if my loved one who is residing at Gateway Home lives beyond

          At times there may be remission of a person’s disease, and it may be
          necessary to be discharged from Gateway Home to an alternative
          placement: such as home, or moving in with a family member, or to a
          Nursing home. It’s amazing to see, and such a blessing, that with some
          conditions, proper symptom control management, socialization and
          tender loving care, people do go into remission and live longer than
          what was expected. The staff at Gateway Home will work closely with
          the Hospice team and family to determine the best alternative
          placement for our resident. Residents may return to Gateway Home and
          die peacefully when that time is appropriate and a bed is available.

            YES! In fact, we could not operate without volunteers. There are
            many volunteer roles, so please consider your individual gifts and
            how you might utilize those to support the Gateway Home. The
            greatest need is resident care volunteers. If you prefer not to work
            with residents, there are numerous other opportunities available.
