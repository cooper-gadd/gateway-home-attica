        "ATTICA — Brick by brick, those who wanted to honor the memory of a Gateway Home resident contributed to walkways at the comfort care facility. They were able to see the results when the walkways were dedicated recently.",
        "Gateway Director Sara Brunner said the brick walkways part of the project took about a year. Gateway, 91 Main St., is a home for the terminally ill offering free comfort care for those in their last three months of a terminal illness.",
        "“We collected brick orders and printed bricks,” she said. “There’s the back walkway and the front walkway. They have a checkered pattern.”",
        "Each brick, Brunner said, is a representation of love and memories from everyone at the dedication.",
        "“Piece by piece, the road to Gateway is truly paved with the beloved remembrances of those who have gone before us. In this way, you have chosen to have their name and their legacy remembered. You have also supported this mission to move forward and make a lasting contribution to others whom we have yet to meet,” she said. “Walking in every morning brings a smile to my face to think of these beautiful souls that we have cared for and the lovely supporters who think that what we’re doing here is worth investing in.”",
        "Brunner invited those who had bought bricks for the walkways to come to Gateway Home when they need to feel close to the loved ones in whose memory they bought them.",
        "“Sit in the garden so exquisitely done by Rosie Domes. It truly is a place of peace,” Brunner said, talking about the effort by Domes, a volunteer.",
        "Brunner told family members of former residents that Gateway thinks of them often and wonders how they’re doing these days.",
        "“Today, we dedicate this memorial and we are not simply erecting a monument or a walkway made of stone, but we’re creating a lasting testament to people’s enduring impact,” she said. “This memorial will serve as a reminder of their contributions and as a symbol of the values they held dear. We appreciate each and every one of you. Without every person in this audience, what we do here and the impact that we make would not be possible.”",
        "Gateway President Doug Domes said the East Hill Foundation has been good to Gateway Home in terms of giving funds, for the brick walkways and also for improvements made at Gateway. He said when East Hill Vice President Warren Greatbatch came to see the home, it was an honor to have him.",
        "“The East Hill Foundation has helped us with, right in the beginning, with some of the demolition that took place, helped us with our kitchen, our shower facilities, roof repair, porch, pergola and our brick and walkway,” he said.",
        "Gateway received more than $121,000 in grant funds, through East Hill, for the improvements, he said.",
        "Brunner said, “Eventually, we’re going to have to be at the end of our journey here. To know that there is something in this community and a whole group of beautiful people waiting to help you makes that thought just a little bit easier. Once you have been here you know that you’re our family. We are honored to be here today to present to you this memorial brick walkway.”",
