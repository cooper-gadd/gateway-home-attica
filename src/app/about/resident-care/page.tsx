          Gateway Home is an empathetic and loving comfort care home for the
          terminally ill. It is a home-like setting that offers free comfort
          care for those in their last three months of a terminal illness.
          Gateway Homeâ€™s staff and trained volunteers are able to care for two
          residents at a time, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

          Our primary goal is to provide comfort care, symptom control and pain
          management for our residents, as well as to be a source of respite
          care for the families and friends. Hands-on resident care is provided
          around the clock, along with meals, laundry, companionship, as well as
          emotional, and spiritual support. Comfort care honors the well-being
          of every person and respects the dignity of human life.

          Admission to Gateway Home is based solely on need, regardless of age,
          sex, race, religion or other distinctions . Referrals come from
          several sources: Hospice, health care agencies, hospitals, physicians,
          social workers, clergy, family, friends or the person themselves.
          Priority is given to those who cannot receive adequate care at home.

          There is no cost to the families that we serve, nor do we receive any

          generosity of our community.
