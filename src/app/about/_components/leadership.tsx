          Doug Domes
        </h2>
        <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          Doug has lived his life as a resident of Attica with wife Rosie of 55
          years. He has four children who have blessed him with 16 beautiful
          grandchildren. As a businessman in the timber industry, Doug knows
          trees to be God’s only renewable natural resource for all of us to use
          wisely and has learned to respect this resource.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          Doug recognizes the value of a human’s heart, soul, and body and as a
          result sees “Gateway Home” as a chance to give back or pass onto those
          in need the blessing God has bestowed on him. He wants to help those
          who are facing their last days, weeks, or possible months on this
          earth not fearing their ultimate departure from this earth. Doug
          believes it is important for them to know they are loved and valued by
          being cared for physically, emotionally, and spiritually. The bible
          states the Golden Rule as “Do unto others as you would have them do
          unto you.” Showing love and caring for others is the means by which we
          all should live.

          give back to Gateway Home for the support they provided. Jim organized
          a Chicken BBQ fundraiser that summer at Gateway Home. After that he
          began serving on the Board of Directors in 2021. Jim continues to
