                  It is a holistic approach to health care that goes beyond the
                  physical wellbeing of the resident, attending to their
                  spiritual, emotional and psychological needs. Hospice care is
                  a specialized form of palliative care designed to support
                  those in the final stages of a terminal illness. Comfort Care
                  is available during the last 90 days of someoneâ€™s life with

                  A nonprofit grant is financial support given to nonprofits by
                  corporations, foundations, or government agencies. They are

                  for additional funding that doesnâ€™t need to be paid back and
                  they increase awareness of their organization. Grants have
                  also allowed us to make some improvements to our property that

                  done to apply for grants in hopes of receiving funds to help
                  keep our doors open. Gateway Home has been fortunate enough to
                  be granted several grants over the years that allowed the

                  All care given at Gateway Home is provided by volunteers or
                  staff members who are trained to provide the best possible
                  care. We change caregivers every two hours during our day and
                  evening shifts so our caregivers come in renewed and
                  refreshed. Our overnight shift from 10-8 is usually manned by
                  one caregiver. Interested individuals do not need to have any
                  healthcare experience to become a volunteer â€“ just an open
                  heart and a willingness to learn how to care for another
                  person. We help volunteers do the rest!

                  Admission to Gateway Home is based on an assessment of those
                  who have the greatest need and the fewest options. A physician
                  must have determined that the person has a terminal illness
                  and is in their last three months of life. We are not able to
                  accept every person who is referred and can only care for up
                  to two dying residents at one time. Each case is evaluated
                  carefully by our Assessment Caregivers and Director of
                  Resident Care and priority is given to those people who have
                  the greatest need at the time; i.e., those who are at home
                  with limited adequate care giving support. Other
                  considerations involve the complexity of nursing care that
                  some people may require.

                  We do not use intravenous fluids, feeding tubes or CPR
                  (resuscitation). It ensures that comfort care, pain
                  management, and symptom control will accompany a natural death
                  process, in an atmosphere filled with love. It is not uncommon
                  to have multiple people waiting for the next available bed.
                  When a bed is available, our Assessment team evaluates all who
                  are waiting, and choose the one who has the greatest need; not
                  who is next on the list for admission.

                  The process for admission to Gateway Home begins with a
                  referral from a physician, social worker, or other healthcare
                  provider. Once a referral is received, our Assessment team
                  will contact the person who is referred to schedule an
                  assessment. The assessment is done in the personâ€™s home or
                  hospital room and takes about an hour. During the assessment,
                  the personâ€™s medical history, current symptoms, and care needs
                  are discussed. The personâ€™s family members or caregivers are
                  also encouraged to participate in the assessment. After the
                  assessment is completed, the person is placed on our waiting
                  list. When a bed becomes available, the person is admitted to
                  Gateway Home. The personâ€™s family members or caregivers are
                  encouraged to visit Gateway Home before the person is admitted
                  to become familiar with the facility and meet the staff. Once
                  the person is admitted, the personâ€™s family members or
                  caregivers are encouraged to visit as often as they like. We
                  also encourage family members or caregivers to participate in
                  the personâ€™s care as much as they are able. We believe that
                  family members and caregivers are an important part of the
                  personâ€™s care team and we welcome their involvement. We also
                  provide support and education to family members and caregivers
                  to help them care for their loved one. We believe that
                  involving family members and caregivers in the personâ€™s care
                  helps to improve the personâ€™s quality of life and provides
                  comfort and support to the person and their family members or
                  caregivers. We also provide support and education to family
                  members and caregivers to help them care for their loved one.

                  and provides comfort and support to the person and their
