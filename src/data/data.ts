    title: "Gateway Home Dedicates Brick Walkways",
    author: "Brain Quinn",
    content: [
      "Brick by brick, those who wanted to honor the memory of a Gateway Home resident contributed to walkways at the comfort care facility. They were able to see the results when the walkways were dedicated recently.",
      "Gateway Director Sara Brunner said the brick walkways part of the project took about a year. Gateway, 91 Main St., is a home for the terminally ill offering free comfort care for those in their last three months of a terminal illness.",
      "“We collected brick orders and printed bricks,” she said. “There’s the back walkway and the front walkway. They have a checkered pattern.”",
      "Each brick, Brunner said, is a representation of love and memories from everyone at the dedication.",
      "“Piece by piece, the road to Gateway is truly paved with the beloved remembrances of those who have gone before us. In this way, you have chosen to have their name and their legacy remembered. You have also supported this mission to move forward and make a lasting contribution to others whom we have yet to meet,” she said. “Walking in every morning brings a smile to my face to think of these beautiful souls that we have cared for and the lovely supporters who think that what we’re doing here is worth investing in.”",
      "Brunner invited those who had bought bricks for the walkways to come to Gateway Home when they need to feel close to the loved ones in whose memory they bought them.",
      "“Sit in the garden so exquisitely done by Rosie Domes. It truly is a place of peace,” Brunner said, talking about the effort by Domes, a volunteer.",
      "Brunner told family members of former residents that Gateway thinks of them often and wonders how they’re doing these days.",
      "“Today, we dedicate this memorial and we are not simply erecting a monument or a walkway made of stone, but we’re creating a lasting testament to people’s enduring impact,” she said. “This memorial will serve as a reminder of their contributions and as a symbol of the values they held dear. We appreciate each and every one of you. Without every person in this audience, what we do here and the impact that we make would not be possible.”",
      "Gateway President Doug Domes said the East Hill Foundation has been good to Gateway Home in terms of giving funds, for the brick walkways and also for improvements made at Gateway. He said when East Hill Vice President Warren Greatbatch came to see the home, it was an honor to have him.",
      "“The East Hill Foundation has helped us with, right in the beginning, with some of the demolition that took place, helped us with our kitchen, our shower facilities, roof repair, porch, pergola and our brick and walkway,” he said.",
      "Gateway received more than $121,000 in grant funds, through East Hill, for the improvements, he said.",
      "Brunner said, “Eventually, we’re going to have to be at the end of our journey here. To know that there is something in this community and a whole group of beautiful people waiting to help you makes that thought just a little bit easier. Once you have been here you know that you’re our family. We are honored to be here today to present to you this memorial brick walkway.”",

      "Another wonderful project for the Gateway Home done and ready for the resident families to enjoy spending time with loved ones on the decorative concrete pad and underneath the new fancy pergola. Once again, it was a project that just simply couldn’t have gotten done without the help of the community stepping up and volunteering.",
      "The hands-on portion of this project started Memorial Day weekend as Doug Domes, Todd Gadd, Greg Scholand and I began digging and prepping the area for concrete. Once the dirt and stone settled through time, the next step was to form and pour the concrete pad. That’s when we needed the expertise of masons. Dave Reding and brothers, Guy and Dustin Westermeier graciously volunteered and stepped in to pour the decorative concrete pad. The team nailed it by doing an absolutely amazing job that shows in the pictures, yet only gives justice when you see it in person.",
      "Last week was the final step to the project. With the help and carpentry skills of Roger Blair, Bill Hulme and Bob Rebmann, the pergola was finally erected. This just brought everything all together in a way that exceeded our expectations since planning the project many months ago.",
      "This project was yet another eye opener. Each volunteer did this not for the pat on the back or praise, but for their community and in some cases, in memory of loved ones of their own. It was truly an honor working with all of them to see this project through.",
      "I’d like to personally thank everyone who helped make this community project possible from start to finish. I know the folks at the Gateway Home are extremely pleased with the outcome and the families who will use it, I’m sure will appreciate what you’ve all done to provide this to them.",
      "If any of you are looking to volunteer at the Gateway Home in any capacity, please feel free to reach out to see what you can do to help.",

Doug believes it is important for them to know they are loved and valued by being cared for physically, emotionally, and spiritually.
